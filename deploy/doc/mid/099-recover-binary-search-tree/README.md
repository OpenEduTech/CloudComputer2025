# [Recover Binary Search Tree][title]

## Description

You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of
**exactly** two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. _Recover the tree
without changing its structure_.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/28/recover1.jpg)
            Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]    Output: [3,1,null,null,2]    Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/28/recover2.jpg)
            Input: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]    Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]    Explanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.    



**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
  * `-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`



**Follow up:** A solution using `O(n)` space is pretty straight-forward. Could
you devise a constant `O(1)` space solution?
